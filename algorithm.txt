Main Algorithm
1. When a user opens the ATM, ask for the name of the user
2. create a new ATM object using the money that the user has and their name
3. Greet the user using the name that they inputted
4. Output a main menu with everything that they can do from there
        3a. this is a sample of what the main menu may look like:
        What would you like to do
        (D)eposit
        (W)ithdrawal
        (C)heck Balance
        (E)xit
5. while user doesn't input E, keep looping
    5a. If a user inputs D, call the Deposit method
    5b. If a user inputs W, call the Withdrawal method
    5c. If a user inputs C, call the CheckBalance method
    5e. If a user doesn't make a valid input (D, W, C, E), ask the user for another input until they input a valid input
6. Call the Leave method

ATM class Algorithm (will have method algorithms in this)\
1. Define the data field (double totalMoney, String name)
2. Create a constructor that will set the data field to the amount of money that the user has
    Deposit Algorithm (double)
    1. Ask the user how much they would like to deposit
        1a. while the amount inputted is either a negative or not a number, keep asking until the user inputs a valid input
    2. add that amount to totalMoney
    3. return totalMoney

    Withdrawal Algorithm (double)
    1. Ask the user how much they would like to withdrawal
    2. while the amount of money to be withdrawn is more than the totalMoney or it is a negative or it is not a number, keep asking until the user inputs a valid input
        2a. Otherwise, subtract that amount from totalMoney
    3. return totalMoney

    Check Balance Algorithm (void)
    1. print "You have " totalMoney " left in your account"

    Leave Algorithm (void)
    1. Ask the user if they want to have their receipt printed or emailed
        1a. if the user selects receipt, remind them to take their receipt
        1b. else, tell the user to check their email
    2. Print a goodbye message
